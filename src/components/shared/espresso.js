        flavor:'Sweet & Light',
        description:'Delightfully sweet and smooth, Volluto Decaffeinato has the same rich flavours and round body as the original Volluto Grand Cru. The selected pure Arabica beans from South America are roasted lightly and separately to highlight their specificities and reveal the sweet biscuity, fresh and fruity notes. The aromatic profile of these coffees is carefully preserved during the decaffeination process, which respects the coffee beanâ€™s true nature, allowing us to maintain the strength and richness of its aromas.'
