        description:'As in the age of sailing ships, West Indian Malabar Arabica beans are exposed to monsoon winds after harvest to reveal a distinguished aromatic profile, rich with cereal notes. We blend these with Latin American Arabica beans to create a lungo with a truly intense character. This full-bodied Lungo, rich in aroma, expresses itself in beautiful sweet cereal and malty toasted notes, and it offers a pleasant bitterness with an exquisite fullness on the palate thanks to its round and smooth texture.'
