# MyPressoApp(https://www.stacypresso.me)

Coffee Blog built with React / Redux / AWS Severless Backend (Lambda, RDS, API Gateway, Amplify) / AWS Route53


## Objectrive
MyPressoApp is a CRUD code blog web-app. I've wanted to create a website where I can get a track of Nespresso capsule orders and personal review for each capsule for later use. 

The frontend was coded in React and Redux for the state management, with scss for styling and responsive design.
Also this app uses Yarn to build and manage dependecies.
The Backend was coded in AWS Lambda and API Gateway with the database in RDS. 
This app also uses AWS Amplify for the deployment and Route53 for reverse proxy.
